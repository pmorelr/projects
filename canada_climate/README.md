Work done throughout the MF204 course, going through the main python tools used for climate change research. 

The `xarray` library was used to read *NetCDF4* files containing global temperature information over the years. 

Additionally, the cartopy library was used for a proper visualization of these data. Several statistical tools were used to obtain predictive climate information.
